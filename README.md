# Aurora 🌌✨💫

Aurora is [Hack Club]([hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com/))'s 2025 San Francisco [Athena Event](https://athena.hackclub.dev/), an initiative started to bridge the gender gap in technology (prev. [Days of Service](https://daysofservice.hackclub.com/)).

On the weekend of July 18th-20th, 2025, a group of female Hack Clubbers gathered to host a 3-day summer camp coding learnathon for young middle and high school students in SF. By the end of the event, all the girls had created their first coding project! 💻

This repo is meant to serve as a point of reference for anyone wanting to organize their own Athena event, especially a multi-day one! If you have any other questions, reach out to [@sahiti](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03RU99SGKA) on Slack. See our open-source planning in the Hack Club Slack #days-of-service channel!

## 🎯 The Goal 

Like past Days of Service & Athena events such as Blossom, Ascend, Horizon, Alpine, Spark, Lonestar, and Halo, our goal was two-fold:
1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, become better leaders, and deepen friendships through fun, collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club’s community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, marginalized gender & race minorities, who lack access to computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.

## Venue
Aurora happened at WeFunder HQ @ 1885 Mission St, SF. I highly reccomend that future hackathons look into using this space, since it's so colorful, perfect for a large hackathon, and the building owner (Dinki) is very accomodating.

## 🥂 Women in STEM Dinner

We had a wonderful dinner with 7 women & 14 girls at the WeFunder HQ backyard & kitchen area. Our caterer was Kitchen Woori (also highly recommend using again) & we were able to donate extra food to a seperate dinner nearby + venue.

We had sent ~20 invites (all confirmed) & the turn out was lower than expected, but the atmosphere of the event was still very welcoming.

## 🧩 Workshops

We split our 3 days into seperate workshop tracks:

- Day 1: Web Development (Build a website with CSS features for 🍨)
- Day 2: Pathfinder PCB (Build a Macropad)
- Day 3: Game Development (Build a platformer with GoDot)
