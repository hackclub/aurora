to aurora f website collaborators
- if ur not a collaborator send me ur github user and i'll add u
- running this requires running **'npm start'** in the terminal
- if u haven't used react before i recommend watching a quick tutorial. if u have any questions dm me @idksarah on slack
- **add page.js and page.css files to src/pages/**
- add images to src/img/
- **if possible** try to **put individual components (eg the topbar of a website) into src/components!! then they are reusable throughout the site and easy to change**

if u haven't used github before:
- plspls commit early and often. make ur commit name's concise and clear because they r vv important
- merge conflicts aren't actually that scary!! if u need help,, again, @idksarah
- if ur modifying someone else's work as they work u might want to make a new branch, but up to ur judgement
