# Aurora

Aurora is a beginner-focused hackathon organized by high schoolers in San Francisco. Itâ€™s part of a series of community events aimed at making tech more accessible, especially for girls and non-binary students.

This repo contains the code and content for the event site, including registration links, workshop info, and logistics.

## Setup

This site is built with React (Vite). To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```
If you're one of the Aurora organizers and would like to make edits, just clone the repo, make your changes, commit, and push. Otherwise, feel free to make a pull request for any changes you'd like to see.
